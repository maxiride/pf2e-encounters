# PF2e Encounter builder

This tool helps building encounters for the popular RPG system, you can browse a list of all creatures or the ones matching the specified criteria, creatures added to the encounter can also be modified to account for their *Weak* and *Elite* variants other than their base stat block. Please refer to the Core Rulebook for the rules.

# Why

There are already several similar tools available, however, none that I found offered the choice for *Weak* and *Elite* variants which is an very handy rule to balance power in an encounter and often oversighted, furthermore they all lacked fine grained filters.

I also wanted to improve my Javascript and Quasar skills, thus this tool was born out of necessity and "sport".
